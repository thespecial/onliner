## Cucumber + Ruby Tests

### Demo

**Sample tests execution output**

```

```

### Requirements

- Ruby 2.5.0
- Chromedriver (to run tests in Chrome)
- Geckodriver (to run tests in Firefox)

To install dependencies (staying at project root) run

`bundle install`

### How To

**See rake tasks**

Running

`rake --tasks`

will output

```
rake report:build      # Generate report
rake report:clear      # Clear reports folder
rake report:run        # Start report server
rake test:normal       # Sequential tests execution
rake test:parallel[n]  # Parallel tests execution
```

**Execute tests**

To run tests in parallel please execute

`rake test:parallel[n]` or (if you're ZSH user) `rake test:parallel\[n\]`

where `n` - number of threads you want to use.


To run tests sequentially

`rake test:normal` or `rake`

Running any of these commands will clear `reports` directory and populate it with new test results.

Currently, `config/config.yml` will tell framework to run tests using Chrome browser in headless mode.
To enable GUI mode just change `headless` param to `false`.

Also it is possible to run tests in Firefox. To do so just change `browser` config param to 'firefox'.

NOTE: in this system headless mode currently supported only for Chrome.

### Reporting

After tests finished execution (staying at project root) run:

```
rake report:build      # will generate index.html file based on reports<n>.json
rake report:run        # will run reports server
```

Here is output of the last command (if everything goes well):

```
Running reports server on http://localhost:8025
[2018-01-23 05:09:20] INFO  WEBrick 1.4.2
[2018-01-23 05:09:20] INFO  ruby 2.5.0 (2017-12-25) [x86_64-darwin16]
[2018-01-23 05:09:20] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=22063 port=8025
```

By default reports server run on port 8025. It can be changed in `.env` file.
Having reports server running you can open report in browser at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).
